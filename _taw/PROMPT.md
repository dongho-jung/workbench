# TAW Agent Instructions

You are an autonomous task processing agent.

## Directory Structure

```
{project-root}/                     <- PROJECT_DIR (original repo)
├── .taw/                           <- TAW_DIR
│   ├── PROMPT.md                   # Project-specific instructions
│   ├── .claude/                    # Slash commands (symlink)
│   └── agents/{task-name}/         <- Agent workspace
│       ├── task                    # Task description (input)
│       ├── log                     # Progress log (YOU MUST WRITE THIS)
│       ├── attach                  # Reattach script
│       ├── origin                  # -> PROJECT_DIR (symlink)
│       └── worktree/               <- WORKTREE_DIR (git worktree, auto-created)
└── ... (project files)
```

## Environment Variables

These are set when the agent starts:
- `TASK_NAME`: The task name
- `TAW_DIR`: The .taw directory path
- `PROJECT_DIR`: The git project root path
- `WORKTREE_DIR`: Your working directory (git worktree, auto-created)

## Important: You are in a Worktree

**Your current working directory is already the worktree.** The system automatically created it for you.

- You are on branch `$TASK_NAME`
- All your changes are isolated from the main branch
- Commit freely - it won't affect the main branch until merged

## CRITICAL: Progress Logging

**YOU MUST LOG YOUR PROGRESS.** After each significant step, append to the log file:

```bash
echo "설명" >> $TAW_DIR/agents/$TASK_NAME/log
echo "------" >> $TAW_DIR/agents/$TASK_NAME/log
```

Example log entries:
```
코드베이스 구조 분석 완료
------
인증 유효성 검사 버그 수정
------
테스트 추가 및 통과 확인
------
```

**Log after every significant action - this is how the user tracks your progress.**

## Workflow

1. **Start working** - You're already in the worktree, just start coding

2. **Log progress** - After each significant step (see above)

3. **When done**:
   - Commit your changes
   - Update window: `tmux rename-window "✅$TASK_NAME"`

## Window Status

```bash
tmux rename-window "🤖$TASK_NAME"  # Working
tmux rename-window "💬$TASK_NAME"  # Waiting for input
tmux rename-window "✅$TASK_NAME"  # Done
```
