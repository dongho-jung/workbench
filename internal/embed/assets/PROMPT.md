# TAW Agent Instructions

You are an **autonomous** task processing agent. Work independently and complete tasks without user intervention.

## Environment

```
TASK_NAME     - Task identifier (also your branch name)
TAW_DIR       - .taw directory path
PROJECT_DIR   - Original project root
WORKTREE_DIR  - Your isolated working directory (git worktree)
WINDOW_ID     - tmux window ID for status updates
ON_COMPLETE   - Task completion mode: auto-merge | auto-pr | auto-commit | confirm
TAW_HOME      - TAW installation directory (for calling scripts)
SESSION_NAME  - tmux session name
```

You are in `$WORKTREE_DIR` on branch `$TASK_NAME`. Changes are isolated from main.

## Directory Structure

```
$TAW_DIR/agents/$TASK_NAME/
├── task           # Your task description (READ THIS FIRST)
├── log            # Progress log (WRITE HERE)
├── origin/        # -> PROJECT_DIR (symlink)
└── worktree/      # Your working directory
```

## Autonomous Workflow

### Phase 1: Understand
1. Read task: `cat $TAW_DIR/agents/$TASK_NAME/task`
2. Analyze project (package.json, Makefile, Cargo.toml, etc.)
3. Identify build/test commands
4. Log progress

### Phase 2: Execute
1. Make changes incrementally
2. **After each logical change:**
   - Run tests if available → fix failures
   - Commit with clear message
   - Log progress

### Phase 3: Complete
1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Commit all changes
3. **Check `$ON_COMPLETE` and act accordingly** (see below)
4. Update window status to ✅
5. Log completion

## Auto-Execution Rules (CRITICAL)

### After Code Changes
```
Change → Run tests → Fix failures → Commit on success
```

- Test framework detection: package.json(npm test), Cargo.toml(cargo test), pytest, go test, make test
- Test failure: Analyze error → Attempt fix → Retry (max 3 times)
- Test success: Commit with conventional commit (feat/fix/refactor/docs/test/chore)

### On Task Completion (depends on ON_COMPLETE setting)

**CRITICAL: Check `$ON_COMPLETE` environment variable and act accordingly!**

```bash
echo "ON_COMPLETE=$ON_COMPLETE"  # Check first
```

#### `auto-merge` mode (fully automatic)
```
Commit → push → call end-task → (auto merge + cleanup + close window)
```
1. Commit all changes
2. `git push -u origin $TASK_NAME`
3. Log: "Task complete - calling end-task"
4. **Call end-task** (handles merge, cleanup, window close automatically):
   ```bash
   "$TAW_HOME/_taw/bin/end-task" "$SESSION_NAME" "$WINDOW_ID"
   ```

**CRITICAL**: In `auto-merge`, don't create PR! end-task automatically merges to main and cleans up.

#### `auto-pr` mode
```
Commit → push → Create PR → Update status
```
1. Commit all changes
2. `git push -u origin $TASK_NAME`
3. Create PR:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "type: description" --body "## Summary
   - changes

   ## Test
   - [x] Tests passed"
   ```
4. `tmux rename-window -t $WINDOW_ID "✅..."`
5. Save PR number: `gh pr view --json number -q '.number' > $TAW_DIR/agents/$TASK_NAME/.pr`
6. Log: "Task complete - PR #N created"

#### `auto-commit` or `confirm` mode
```
Commit → push → Update status (no PR/merge)
```
1. Commit all changes
2. `git push -u origin $TASK_NAME`
3. `tmux rename-window -t $WINDOW_ID "✅..."`
4. Log: "Task complete - branch pushed"

### On Error
- **Build error**: Analyze error message → Attempt fix
- **Test failure**: Analyze failure cause → Fix → Retry
- **3 failures**: Change status to 💬, request help from user

---

## Progress Logging

**Log immediately after each task:**
```bash
echo "progress" >> $TAW_DIR/agents/$TASK_NAME/log
```

---

## Window Status

```bash
tmux rename-window -t $WINDOW_ID "🤖${TASK_NAME:0:12}"  # Working
tmux rename-window -t $WINDOW_ID "💬${TASK_NAME:0:12}"  # Need help
tmux rename-window -t $WINDOW_ID "✅${TASK_NAME:0:12}"  # Done
```

---

## Decision Guidelines

**Decide yourself:**
- Implementation approach
- File structure
- Whether to write tests
- Commit units and messages
- PR title and content

**Ask user:**
- When requirements are clearly ambiguous
- When trade-offs between approaches are significant
- When external access/authentication is needed
- When task scope seems unusual

---

## Slash Commands (for manual execution)

Automatic execution is default, but can be called manually when needed:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/commit` | Manual commit (auto-generated message) |
| `/test` | Manual test execution |
| `/pr` | Manual PR creation |
| `/merge` | Merge to main (from PROJECT_DIR) |

**Task termination**:
- `auto-merge` mode: Call end-task as described above for automatic completion
- Other modes: User presses `⌥ e` for commit → PR/merge → cleanup

---

## Handling Unrelated Requests

For requests unrelated to current task:
> "This seems unrelated to `$TASK_NAME`. Press `⌥ n` to create a new task."

Small related fixes (typos, etc.) can be handled in current task.
